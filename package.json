  "readme": "# React Native Photo Browser\n\nA full screen image gallery with captions, selections and grid view support for react-native. Layout and API design are inspired by great [MWPhotoBrowser](https://github.com/mwaterfall/MWPhotoBrowser) library.\n\nThe component has both iOS and Android support.\n\n### Neogrowth Contribution\nNeogrowth bring the support for zoom in and zoom out of the image and some minor bug fixes are taken care. For which the following is the dependency.\n\n[react-native-photo-view](https://github.com/alwx/react-native-photo-view/)\n\n\n\n![](screenshots/photo-browser.gif)\n\n![](screenshots/screenshot-1.png)\n![](screenshots/screenshot-2.png)\n\n### Installation\n```npm install https://github.com/NeoGrowth-Credit-Pvt-Limited/react-native-photo-browser.git --save```\n\n#### android/settings.gradle\nAdd the following line\n\n    include ':react-native-photo-view'\n    project(':react-native-photo-view').projectDir = file('../node_modules/react-native-photo-view/android')\n\n#### android/build.gradle\nadd `compile project` in  dependencies\n\n    dependencies {\n      .\n      .\n      compile project(':react-native-photo-view')\n    }\n\n#### android/app/build.gradle\n    allprojects {\n        repositories {\n            mavenLocal()\n            jcenter()\n            maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" } // <-- Add this\n            maven {\n                // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm\n                url \"$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n#### MainApplication.java\n\n      import com.reactnative.photoview.PhotoViewPackage; // add this import\n      public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n\n      private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {\n        @Override\n        protected boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {\n          return BuildConfig.DEBUG;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n          return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n              new MainReactPackage(),\n              new RNSimpleAlertDialogPackage(),\n              .\n              .\n              .\n              new PhotoViewPackage() // add this manager\n          );\n        }\n      };\n\n      @Override\n      public ReactNativeHost getReactNativeHost() {\n          return mReactNativeHost;\n      }\n    }\n\n### Properties\n\n| Prop | Type | Description | Default |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**`mediaList`**|Array\\<Media\\>|List of [media objects](#media-object) to display.|`[]`|\n|**`initialIndex`**|Number|Sets the visible photo initially.|`0`|\n|**`alwaysShowControls`**|Boolean|Allows to control whether the bars and controls are always visible or whether they fade away to show the photo full.|`false`|\n|**`displayActionButton`**|Boolean|Show action button to allow sharing, copying, etc.|`false`|\n|**`displayNavArrows`**|Boolean|Whether to display left and right nav arrows on bottom toolbar.|`false`|\n|**`enableGrid`**|Boolean|Whether to allow the viewing of all the photo thumbnails on a grid.|`true`|\n|**`startOnGrid`**|Boolean|Whether to start on the grid of thumbnails instead of the first photo.|`false`|\n|**`displaySelectionButtons`**|Boolean|Whether selection buttons are shown on each image.|`false`|\n|**`useCircleProgress`**_iOS_|Boolean|Displays Progress.Circle instead of default Progress.Bar for full screen photos. Check [Progress](#progress-component) section for more info.|`false`|\n|**`onSelectionChanged`**|Function|Called when a media item is selected or unselected.|`(media, index, isSelected) => {}`|\n|**`onActionButton`**|Function|Called when action button is pressed for a photo. Your application should handle sharing process, please see [Sharing](#sharing) section for more information. If you don't provide this method, action button tap event will simply be ignored.|`(media, index) => {}`|\n|**`onBack`**|Function|Called when back button is tapped.|`() => {}`|\n|**`itemPerRow`**|Number|Sets images amount in grid row.|`3`|\n\n### Media Object\n\n```js\nconst media = {\n  thumb: '', // thumbnail version of the photo to be displayed in grid view. actual photo is used if thumb is not provided\n  photo: '', // a remote photo or local media url\n  caption: '', // photo caption to be displayed\n  selected: true, // set the photo selected initially(default is false)\n};\n```\n\n\n### Progress Component\n\n#### Android\n\nBuilt-in [ActivityIndicator](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/activityindicator.html) component is used for Android. Any additional configuration is not needed. [ProgressBarAndroid](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/progressbarandroid.html) is deprecated now.\n\n#### iOS\n\n[react-native-progress](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-progress) component is used as progress indicator. The default progress component is `Progress.Bar`. You can also use `Progress.Circle` component by simply using `useCircleProgress` prop, and adding `ReactART` library to your Xcode project. For more information please check out [react-native-progress repo](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-progress#reactart-based-components) and [React Native documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).\n\n### Sharing\n\nI tried delivering sharing photo feature but it was complicated to provide for iOS and android out of the box. I now believe it's a better idea to separate sharing logic into another module. Please check out Example project to see a basic ActionSheetIOS implementation for iOS. You may also use available sharing libraries such as [react-native-activity-view](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-activity-view) and [react-native-share](https://github.com/EstebanFuentealba/react-native-share).\n\n### Examples\n\nSee [PhotoBrowserExample.js](Example/PhotoBrowserExample.js) file.\n\nFollow those steps to run the example:\n\n1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/NeoGrowth-Credit-Pvt-Limited/react-native-photo-browser/Example`\n2. Install dependencies `npm install`\n3. Follow [official instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to run the example project in a simulator or device.\n\n### Roadmap\n- [x] Android support\n- [ ] Improve performance for bigger collections\n- [ ] Video support\n- [ ] Photo zoom\n- [ ] Zooming photos to fill the screen\n\n### Licence\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html)\n",
